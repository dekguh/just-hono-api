# Services

This directory contains business logic and service layer implementations.

## Purpose

The `services` folder contains the core business logic of your application. Services handle complex operations, data processing, and external API integrations while keeping controllers thin and focused on HTTP concerns.

## Structure

- `index.ts` - Main service exports
- `auth.service.ts` - Authentication and authorization logic
- `user.service.ts` - User management business logic
- `post.service.ts` - Post/Article business logic
- `email.service.ts` - Email sending functionality
- `file.service.ts` - File upload/management logic

## Usage

```typescript
// Import services
import { AuthService, UserService } from '../services'

// Use in controllers
const authService = new AuthService()
const user = await authService.signIn(email, password)
```

## Service Responsibilities

### Business Logic
- Data validation and processing
- Complex business rules
- Data transformation
- Business calculations

### External Integrations
- Database operations
- Third-party API calls
- Email services
- File storage

### Data Management
- CRUD operations
- Data aggregation
- Caching strategies
- Transaction management

## Best Practices

- Keep services stateless when possible
- Use dependency injection for external dependencies
- Handle errors gracefully
- Write comprehensive tests
- Document complex business logic
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error handling and logging
