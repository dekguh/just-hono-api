# Tests

This directory contains test files for the application.

## Purpose

The `__tests__` folder contains all test files including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Structure

- `unit/` - Unit tests for individual functions and classes
- `integration/` - Integration tests for API endpoints
- `e2e/` - End-to-end tests for complete user flows
- `fixtures/` - Test data and mock objects
- `helpers/` - Test utility functions

## Test Organization

### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions and methods
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on isolated functionality
- Fast execution

### Integration Tests
- Test API endpoints
- Test database interactions
- Test middleware functionality
- Test service layer

### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete user workflows
- Test real HTTP requests
- Test full application stack
- Simulate user behavior

## Usage

```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('AuthService', () => {
  it('should sign in user with valid credentials', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  })
})
```

## Testing Best Practices

- Write tests for all business logic
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and error cases
- Keep tests independent
- Use test fixtures for data
- Implement proper test coverage
- Use TypeScript for test files
